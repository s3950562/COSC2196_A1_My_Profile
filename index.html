					<p>My name is Timothy and I’m a 31-year-old Australian currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I was raised in far western NSW working at a local Hobbies and Electronics store and a Bed and Breakfast from the age of 14. After I completed my Higher School Certificate (HSC), I relocated to Adelaide, Australia to pursue further education and expand my horizons.</p> 
					<p>While completing a Bachelor of Marketing and Management at the University of South Australia, I began to work within the Real Estate industry where I grew and developed professionally for 10 years, eventually becoming a large portfolio manager within a company specialising with International Students and the Australian Education System.</p>
					<p>Due to the experience and connections made personally and professionally, I have had the opportunity to travel domestically and abroad, visiting countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Kuwait, and Dubai. During these travels, I would immerse myself within the culture and would always be eager to try, learn and experience the life in the moment including languages, cultures, food, events, and more.</p>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>During my teenage years, I was employed at a local Hobbies and Electronics store, where my main duties were to assist the technician. The teachings and experiences from this technician were built around the moto “I’ll show you, now you try”; giving me a valuable opportunity to learn to get hands on with a variety of tasks, such as soldering radios, building PCs, and troubleshooting through technical problems.</p>
					<p>Later in schooling while undertaking an IT course for the HSC, I was selected to undertake Work Experience within the IT department of the local hospital, that similarly dealt with hardware and cabling, but also networking, troubleshooting, and software maintenance. Due to my interest in the placement, I would return to do placement at the IT department for the second run of the work experiences at the request of the Hospital Management.</p>
					<p>I initially started my university studies in a Bachelor of Information Technology, however due to reasons I switched into Business as a major. Despite this, I personally continued to have an interest in IT that has recently carried over to streaming on Twitch using programs such as OBS, streamelements, and more.</p>

							<p>In terms of the technical aspect of the role, I am currently undergoing Python via the program at RMIT, as well as further development in the degree as I progress. The technical skills will need to be acquired, however this gives a path to overall work towards, to understand web protocols, standards, programming languages such as Java and Scala, and overall understanding of cloud-computing and its structure.</p>
						<h3><span class="bolded">Skills Required</span></h3>

					<h2><span class="bolded">Overview</span></h2>
					<p>The results overall do accurately display my traits of my teamwork and leadership, both in professional and personality contexts. I acknowledge that I’m an empathetic person with which I’ve been able to adapt to both personal and professional settings.</p>

					<h2><span class="bolded">Myers Briggs Type Indicator</span></h2>
					<p>These results show me that I tend to be resourceful and practical, which is supported by my preference in visual learn. I have difficulties in concentrates while reading and usually take several reviews to digest the information presented. I am extroverted when I am comfortable, however in settings that I am not familiar with the surroundings I take moments to settle in.</p>
					<p>Generally, I describe myself of being quite aware of the feelings of others and the environment itself, by understanding body language, facial reactions, and the general audience, therefore taking in considerations of feelings when making decisions. I am confident that these results show how I’ve been able to build a community from streaming with regulars tuning in each stream, as well as professional been successful as a leader to others. Therefore, I am confident this will also be a strength within a team setting despite being based online.</p>

				  <h2><span class="bolded">Learning Assessment Test</span></h2>
					<p>Being a visual learner is not a surprising result, as for as long as I’ve known, I’ve always learned better visually or practically than by written steps. This has always led me to areas of more visual or reactionary tasks such as: Streaming uses many visual effects and assets that even if there is coding involved, I can quickly create what is going to be seen on the viewers side.</p>
					<p>Professionally, I would regularly create and implement visual data tracking for reporting purposes, this would assist me to articulate to management or stakeholders as well as for my own visual understanding on how we are tracking.</p>
					<p>In personal settings, I rather read comics then books, watch a YouTube guide then read a step by step. Not in all circumstances, however often I will have both resources available to view and use the visual queues to prompt my understanding of the texted guide.</p>

					<h2><span class="bolded">Creativity Test</span></h2>
					<p>These results align with my personal understanding in the creativity context. I am very much a curious individually who would regularly test or try something new as it the results maybe be suprising; I like make sure I am actioning tasks in the most efficient way for both personal and team-based benefit.</p>
					<p>Further, many ideas that are creative, efficient, and fulfilling should be explored as regardless of the outcome being positive or negative; the journey may present other avenues to explore; I actively foster a creative environment in personal and professional settings due to this belief.</p>
					<p>However, my persistence score is the weakest of the results, which also supports the Myers-Briggs results being an ESFP, where I can become stressed easily with too much structure, micromanagement, or being pushed into a decision making scenario where the information isn’t full at my disposal.</p>
